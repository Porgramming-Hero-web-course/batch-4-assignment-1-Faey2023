## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

The significance of **union** and **intersection** types in TypeScript is their ability to define more flexible and precise types, ensuring better type safety and avoiding errors.

A **union type** describes a value that can be of several types at once. The types are separated by a vertical bar (`|`), so `number | string | boolean` is a type that allows a value to be either a `number`, `string`, or `boolean`. This feature is useful when a value could belong to one of several types, that allows to avoid type errors and making the code convenient to different inputs.

**Example:**

```typescript
function union(value: string, address: string | number) {}
```

In this example, the `address` can either be a `string` or a `number`, providing flexibility that ensures type safety.

An **intersection type** allows us to combine multiple types into one. It results in a single type that includes all the properties and features of the combined types. This is useful when we want to create a type that can have multiple characteristics, ensuring that a value has all the conditions of the combined types.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Address {
  street: string;
  city: string;
}

type PersonAndAddress = Person & Address;

const personAndAddress: PersonAndAddress = {
  name: "Faheema Harun",
  age: 24,
  street: "Kandirpar",
  city: "Cumilla",
};
```

In this example, `personAndAddress` is an intersection type that combines both the `Person` and `Address` interfaces. The object `personAndAddress` will have both the `Person` and `Address` interfaces, including all their properties.
